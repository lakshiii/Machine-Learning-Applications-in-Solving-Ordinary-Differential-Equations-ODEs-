# Machine Learning Applications in Solving Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)

This repository explores how machine learning techniques, especially Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs), can be applied to solve Ordinary Differential Equations efficiently. The project includes examples, implementation details, and real-world applications.

## Features

- **Neural ODE Implementation**: Code for modeling continuous dynamics using Neural ODEs.
- **Comparison with Traditional Methods**: Analyze performance against numerical methods like Euler and Runge-Kutta.
- **Real-world Applications**: Case studies in physics, biology, and finance.
- **Custom Dataset Integration**: Supports user-provided datasets for ODE modeling.

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries and Frameworks**:
  - PyTorch: For building and training Neural ODE models
  - NumPy: For data preprocessing and numerical operations
  - Matplotlib: For visualizing results
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Interactive examples and tutorials

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/machine-learning-odes.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd machine-learning-odes
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
